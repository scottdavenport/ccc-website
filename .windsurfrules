# General Project Rules
- Use Next.js with Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Follow a grid-based layout for sponsor displays.
- Use Framer Motion for subtle animations and transitions.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with Tailwind utilities.

# Sponsor Showcase
- Champion Sponsors ($5,000+) should be featured in a hero section.
- Other sponsors should be displayed in a responsive grid.
- Implement category filters (Champion, Eagle, Hole-in-One, All Sponsors).
- Use hover effects with slight scaling and a soft shadow.

# Code Organization
- Store reusable components in `/components/`
- Store sponsor data in `/data/sponsors.json` (until Firebase is integrated)
- Store images/logos in `/public/assets/sponsors/`
- Fetch dynamic sponsor data via a function in `/lib/firebase.js` (future)

# Performance & Optimization
- Optimize images before deployment.
- Use Next.js <Image> component for better performance.
- Ensure SEO-friendly metadata with `next-seo`.
